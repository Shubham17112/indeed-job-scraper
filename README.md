# Indeed Job Scraper

## Overview
This project is a Python-based web scraper designed to extract job listings from Indeed.com using two methods: Selenium for dynamic JavaScript-heavy pages and BeautifulSoup with requests for static content. It scrapes job details such as title, company, location, salary, summary, and URL, and saves the results to CSV and JSON files.

## Features
- **Selenium-based scraping**: Handles JavaScript-rendered pages for reliable data extraction.
- **Requests-based scraping**: A lightweight fallback method for static content (less reliable due to JavaScript dependencies).
- **CAPTCHA detection**: Checks for CAPTCHA challenges during scraping.
- **Human-like delays**: Implements random delays to mimic human behavior and avoid detection.
- **Data storage**: Saves scraped job data to both CSV and JSON formats.
- **Error handling**: Robust logging and exception handling to ensure stability.
- **Configurable search**: Allows customization of job title, location, and number of pages to scrape.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Dependencies**:
  - `beautifulsoup4`: For parsing HTML content.
  - `selenium`: For handling dynamic web pages.
  - `requests`: For making HTTP requests.
  - `webdriver-manager`: For managing WebDriver binaries (e.g., ChromeDriver).
- **WebDriver**: A compatible browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver) is required for Selenium. The `webdriver-manager` package can automatically handle this.
- **Internet connection**: Required to access Indeed.com and fetch job listings.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure a compatible browser (e.g., Chrome) is installed for Selenium.

## Usage
1. Configure the scraper by updating the `constants.py` file with the desired `BASE_URL` (e.g., `https://www.indeed.com`).
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python indeed_scraper.py
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Search for jobs based on the specified `job_title` (e.g., "Python Developer") and `location` (e.g., "Delhi").
   - Scrape the specified number of pages (`num_pages`).
   - Save results to `indeed_jobs.csv` and `indeed_jobs.json` (or backup files if the Selenium method fails).
4. Example output:
   ```
   Starting Indeed job scraping...
   Searching for: Python Developer in Delhi
   Pages to scrape: 3
   Found 45 jobs!
   First 3 jobs found:
   1. Python Developer
      Company: ABC Corp
      Location: Delhi
      Salary: â‚¹50,000 a month
      Summary: Develop and maintain Python-based applications...
      URL: https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=...
   ...
   ```

## File Structure
- `indeed_scraper.py`: Main script containing the `IndeedScraper` class and scraping logic.
- `init.py`: Contains the `ScraperInitializer` base class for setting up Selenium and requests sessions.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for human-like delays, CAPTCHA detection, and saving data to CSV/JSON.
- `constants.py`: Configuration file for the base URL and other constants.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Customization
- **Job Search Parameters**: Modify `job_title`, `location`, and `num_pages` in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block of `indeed_scraper.py`.
- **Output Files**: Change the output filenames in the `save_to_csv` and `save_to_json` calls.
- **Logging**: Adjust logging settings in `init.py` for more or less verbose output.

## Notes
- **CAPTCHA Handling**: The scraper detects CAPTCHAs but does not solve them. Manual intervention or a CAPTCHA-solving service is required if detected.
- **Selenium vs. Requests**: Selenium is more reliable for Indeed due to its JavaScript-heavy pages, but the requests method is included as a lightweight backup.
- **Rate Limiting**: The scraper includes random delays to avoid being blocked, but excessive scraping may still trigger rate limits or CAPTCHAs.
- **Data Accuracy**: Some fields (e.g., salary) may not always be available and will be marked as 'N/A'.

## Limitations
- The requests-based method may fail to extract data from pages that rely heavily on JavaScript.
- CAPTCHA challenges can interrupt scraping, requiring manual intervention.
- The scraper is tailored for Indeed.com and may need adjustments for other job boards.
